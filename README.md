# Arch Linux Calamares Installer or ALCI

Use the correct version for building the iso.

Read the archiso.readme.

Download the content of the github with (in terminal)

git clone https://github.com/arcolinuxiso/alci-iso

Change the content of packages.x86-64 or not.

Start building your own ALCI version with 

sudo ./build.sh -v

You will get an iso in the OUT folder.

Burn it and use it.

Still not sure what to do
